# Speak-Sense-AI Transcriber & Tone Analyzer
SpeakSense is an AI-powered application that converts speech to text and analyzes the emotional tone of the transcribed text. Built using Whisper AI for transcription and TextBlob for tone analysis, this tool provides accurate speech recognition along with insights into the sentiment of the spoken content.

Key Features:
✅ Speech-to-Text Conversion – Converts uploaded audio into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
✅ Tone Analysis – Detects whether the transcribed text carries a positive, negative, or neutral tone.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Built with Gradio for an easy and interactive experience.

This project can be useful for content creators, journalists, researchers, or anyone looking to analyze spoken content efficiently.
